# Anchor

Anchor version represents both an evolution in my personal website's design philosophy and at the same time, a simplification. Named after the mighty HTML `<a>` tag, this redesign focuses on creating a comprehensive digital home that best reflects the Anand of 2025.

It's based on the same APIs as previous iterations of my website, and serves as a central hub that brings together all facets of my digital presence, creating a living document that automatically updates as my life evolves.

## Design

The Anchor design is built around the principle of "living documentation." Removing almost all than static content, the website now serves as a dynamic dashboard that reflects my current activities, location, and state of mind.

I tried to keep it very clean and minimal, but still reflecting the colorful me, and for the first time - with dark mode!

The site organizes content into logical sections: /now, /life, /events, /blog, etc., and really leans into the whole "hyperlink" concept, literally naming each section with a slash prefix. Each section provides a curated view of different aspects of my work and life, making it easy for visitors to find what interests them most. And for the first time, I moved the entire navbar to the footer and focused purely on the content at the top.

## Stack

On every new Version, I use a brand new stack to play with new technologies, and this time was no different. I enjoyed using async React components for the first time, and the site uses Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) practically everywhere. Built with Next.js 15 and React using TypeScript.

I really leaned into showing real-time live data in the previous version of my website, so I continued that pattern and the homepage displays live data about my current activities, including my age (with decimal precision), current location, yearly theme, fitness stats, sleep quality, and coding activity.
